## Tracing

This Ruby gem provides a simple API for tracing and also supports [OpenTracing](http://opentracing.io/).  See the [Ruby Tracing SDK](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=ruby-tracing-sdk) and [OpenTracing](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=ruby-opentracing) pages for details.

## Documentation

You can find more documentation covering supported components and minimum versions in the Instana [documentation portal](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=technologies-monitoring-ruby).

## Want End User Monitoring (EUM)?

Instana provides deep end user monitoring that links server side traces with browser events to give you a complete view from server to browser.

See the [End User Monitoring](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/instana-observability/current?topic=instana-monitoring-websites) page for more information.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bundle exec rake console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `lib/instana/version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
