module Instana
  # Type of span. Can be used to specify additional relationships between spans in addition to a
  # parent/child relationship. For API ergonomics, use of the symbols rather than the constants
  # may be preferred. For example:
  #
  #   span = tracer.on_start('op', kind: :client)
  module SpanKind
    # Instana specific spans
